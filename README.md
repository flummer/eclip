# eClip function boards

![Different eClip function boards and programmers](https://github.com/flummer/eclip/raw/main/IMAGES/function-boards.jpg "Different eClip function boards and programmers")

This is a few different function boards I designed for the [DFRobot eClip](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1307.html) mini programming fixture.

The boards are **very** simple and requires suitable pogo pins and header pins. Be sure to check diameter when looking up pogo pins, as most of these are designed for relatively small pogo pins with a diameter of 1 mm.
